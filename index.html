    <!-- This is a note to note what notes are ;) -->

    <p>
      Hi! I am Andrés. I am game developer, artist, and tech-tinkerer. I have
      been drawing my whole life. Sometimes, drawing is easier than words. I
      love making things. This is a collection of my 2D work for you to be
      convinced that we can work nicely together :)
